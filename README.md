# LNURL Kit ⚡🐱
![badge](https://github.com/lsunsi/lnurlkit/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)

A ready-to-use¹ implementation of the [LNURL](https://github.com/lnurl/luds) specification.

This library works as a toolkit so you can serve and make your LNURL requests with ease.

¹ _Soon to be. Currently it's still on early stages and should be considered experimental._

###### Soon. ™

## Future work
- Remove SOS signs from above list (by just working on it)
- Add types helpers and all the stuff needed for the server side
- Make it client agnostic (currently it uses [reqwest](https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest))
- Make it both sync and async (I want no part in this war)
- Breaking it into client / structures (flexibility right)
- Better, WAY better error handling. Geez

###### Thanks
